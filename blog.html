          <h3>Keshi</h3>
          <p>
            Born Casey Luong, Keshi grew up in the suburbs of Houston, Texas.
            After picking up his grandfather's guitar at 13 (despite his
            mother's many protests), he taught himself how to play, and fell in
            love with the intricacies of songwriting, mixing, and producing.
            Before the 27-year-old was working with YSL for his tour looks and
            selling out Los Angeles's Fonda Theater and Webster Hall in New
            York, he wrestled with dual identities. How could he balance the
            worlds of Casey, the person, and Keshi, the artist?

          <h3>Laufey</h3>
          <p>
            Born Laufey Lín Jónsdóttir, she spent her childhood divided between
            Reykjavík and Washington, D.C., absorbing classical and jazz music
            and even performing with the Iceland Symphony Orchestra as a
            teenager. Around this time, she also gave the judges goose bumps on
            Iceland Got Talent, performing a solo piano rendition of Grace
            Potter's "Stars." The next year, she secured a spot on The Voice
            Iceland with her take on Whitney Houston's "I Have Nothing." When it
            was time for college, Lín was awarded the Presidential Scholarship
            for Berklee College of Music in Boston. While there, she picked up
            modern influences, collaborated with peers, and honed her skills as
            a vocalist, instrumentalist, and songwriter.
