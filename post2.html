          <h3>About Laufey</h3>
          <p>
            Born Laufey Lín Jónsdóttir, she spent her childhood divided between
            Reykjavík and Washington, D.C., absorbing classical and jazz music
            and even performing with the Iceland Symphony Orchestra as a
            teenager. Around this time, she also gave the judges goose bumps on
            Iceland Got Talent, performing a solo piano rendition of Grace
            Potter's "Stars." The next year, she secured a spot on The Voice
            Iceland with her take on Whitney Houston's "I Have Nothing." When it
            was time for college, Lín was awarded the Presidential Scholarship
            for Berklee College of Music in Boston. While there, she picked up
            modern influences, collaborated with peers, and honed her skills as
            a vocalist, instrumentalist, and songwriter.
            <br /><br />
            Icelandic-Chinese singer/songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Laufey
            brings a jazz-influenced, traditional pop style into the 21st
            century with soothing songs inspired by artists such as Ella
            Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Peggy Lee, Chet Baker, and George
            Gershwin. Like a younger sibling to more contemporary acts like
            Norah Jones and Fiona Apple, the musician made her official debut in
            the early 2020s with her viral hit "Street by Street," which was
            popular on social media platforms and caught the attention of famous
            fans Billie Eilish and Willow Smith. Laufey's debut EP, Typical of
            Me, arrived in April 2021. She later expanded upon that with her
            official first album, 2022's Everything I Know About Love.
            <br /><br />
            After she recorded her first official single, "Street by Street,"
            school was abruptly halted because of the COVID-19 pandemic. During
            the resulting worldwide lockdown, Laufey began recording and
            building her audience on social media, showcasing her instrumental
            abilities on guitar, cello, and piano and sharing her voice with
            fans around the world. "Street by Street" eventually reached number
            one on the Icelandic Radio Charts. She soon issued the tracks "Best
            Friend" and "Someone New." All three songs landed on her debut EP,
            2021's Typical of Me.
            <br /><br />
            In August 2022, Laufey released her first full-length, Everything I
            Know About Love. Anchored by the bossa nova-inspired single "Falling
            Behind," the album reached the Top 20 in Iceland and 14 on
            Billboard's Heatseekers Chart. The following month, she embarked on
            a sold-out North American headline tour. Another single, "Questions
            for the Universe," arrived that October.
