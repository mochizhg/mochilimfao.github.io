          <h3>About Keshi</h3>
          <p>
            Born Casey Luong, Keshi grew up in the suburbs of Houston, Texas.
            After picking up his grandfather's guitar at 13 (despite his
            mother's many protests), he taught himself how to play, and fell in
            love with the intricacies of songwriting, mixing, and producing.
            Before the 27-year-old was working with YSL for his tour looks and
            selling out Los Angeles's Fonda Theater and Webster Hall in New
            York, he wrestled with dual identities. How could he balance the
            worlds of Casey, the person, and Keshi, the artist?
            <br /><br />
            Following his graduation from the University of Texas at Austin, he
            fulfilled many of the roles Casey was expected to achieve. His
            Vietnamese immigrant parents disapproved of music, so Casey got a
            job as an oncology nurse. Yet, there was still the unshakeable voice
            in his head, refusing to let his passion wane. After Casey’s shifts
            at the hospital would end, he’d immediately morph into Keshi. He
            posted music on SoundCloud under the moniker—born from a nickname
            coined by his fiancé’s parents. Compartmentalizing his identities
            made it easier to bare his soul on wax. Joining SoundCloud was the
            spark that would later explode into a conflagration of
            music-industry moves.
            <br /><br />
            Soon, he gained fans after submitting his first song, “If You’re Not
            the One for Me Who Is,” to a small subreddit’s monthly music
            competition—and winning the contest outright. With his consistent
            SoundCloud presence, he grew his fanbase from just 500 Instagram
            followers to millions of dedicated members, catching the eye of his
            current label, Island Records in the process. He flew out to New
            York in 2019 to perform for executives in the hope of getting
            signed. After winning them over and securing a record deal, he quit
            his job.
            <br /><br />
            Leaving nursing caused Keshi to question whether he was on the right
            path. He explains that while not knowing how to speak Vietnamese
            gave him a unique relationship with his identity, many aspects of
            Vietnamese culture, like collectivism, are still deeply embedded
            within him—and these same insecurities about leaving home still
            consume him to this day. “I am nervous about my future, for sure.
            Because the idea of it used to be so simple. It was like, work 9 to
            5, have kids, come home, play the guitar when I’m bored,” Keshi
            says. “But now, I see the tip top of a mountain that I have the
            opportunity to climb up. And there’s this pressure on me to do it,
            because I can see the top.”
