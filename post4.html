          <h3>About Dv4d</h3>
          <p>
            18 year old singer and songwriter, David Burke (born. March 28th,
            2005) better known by his stage name d4vd, is known to be the most
            versatile up-and-coming artists of 2022 hailing from Queens, New
            York.
            <br /><br />
            Despite recording his most viral songs on just his iPhone, he’s
            taken over the internet with his gratifying voice, somber lyrics,
            and vintage production that was poised to blow up. d4vd began
            releasing music on streaming platforms in November, 2021. In the
            early stages of David’s music career, he would release rap and indie
            songs along with a drill mixtape named “The Hoodstar Diary.”
            <br /><br />
            d4vd often experiments with his sound, making songs with genres like
            Indie, RnB, Hip-Hop, and Rock. In July 2022, he received tons of
            recognition after releasing his most popular tracks, “Romantic
            Homicide” and “Here With Me”
            <br /><br />
            A month after his rapid rise to fame, his hit single “Romantic
            Homicide” debuted at #77 on the Billboard Hot 100 during the chart
            week ending of September 17, 2022. It’s known to be d4vd’s first
            entry on the chart. "I want d4vd to be a genre in itself, so I try
            to be as versatile as I can with the sounds that I use and how I
            convey emotion." - d4vd
